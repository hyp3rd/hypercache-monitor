# HyperCache Monitor

Operator control panel for [HyperCache](https://github.com/hyp3rd/hypercache)
distributed cache clusters. **v0.11.0 · Phase C+ complete** — every operator
surface is shipped: multi-cluster registry, live SSE topology, Eviction
Controls (admin-scoped), per-cluster identity from `/v1/me`, hostname-
default cluster routing, per-cluster logout, and optional auth.js v5 OIDC
sign-in (with automatic token refresh + RP-initiated logout) alongside the
existing operator-issued bearer flow.

## Architecture

```text

                                    └──────────────┘
```

The browser **never** addresses the cache directly — three reasons:

1. **CORS is absent** on both cache listeners. Browser → cache fails out of the box.
1. **Bearer-in-browser is XSS-readable**. The only safe shape for a financial-environment
   panel is an httpOnly session cookie sealed by [iron-session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session).
1. **Admin-scope gating** is enforced in two places: the cache's
   management port enforces `admin` scope server-side on `/evict` /
   `/clear` / `/trigger-expiration` (shipped in Phase C, see the cache
   repo's per-route policy enforcement); the monitor's proxy still
   gates the same scope client-side, so a read-only token never reaches
   the upstream mutating routes through the UI.

Every request flows: browser → Next.js edge proxy
([src/proxy.ts](src/proxy.ts)) gates the session → API route
([src/lib/api/proxy.ts](src/lib/api/proxy.ts)) attaches the bearer token from the
sealed cookie + injects an `X-Request-Id` for cross-process correlation.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** App Router + React 19 + TypeScript strict
  (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, `isolatedModules`)
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4** (CSS-first config, no `tailwind.config.js`)
- **iron-session v8** for the per-cluster session bindings
- **auth.js v5** (next-auth) for the optional OIDC sign-in flow,
  layered alongside the static-bearer paste form
- **TanStack Query v5** for client-side polling fallback (Topology
  uses SSE first; metrics + bulk + key inspector poll at 2s / 30s)
- **EventSource** (browser-native) for the Topology live updates
- **Recharts** via shadcn/ui charts for the Metrics dashboard
- **TanStack Table v8** for the Bulk-operations results tables
- **Hey API** (`@hey-api/openapi-ts`) for typed clients off the cache's OpenAPI 3.1 spec
- **Vitest + Playwright + axe-core** for tests
- Self-hosted **Roboto / Roboto Slab / Roboto Mono** via `next/font/google`

## Prerequisites

- Node 25 (or current LTS). Pinned in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) and
  [package.json#engines](package.json).
- A running HyperCache cluster — see the
  [cache repo's quickstart](https://github.com/hyp3rd/hypercache).
  Local 5-node cluster: `make start-dev-scaled`
  (requires a sibling checkout of the cache repo).

## Quick start

```bash
nvm use            # Node 25
npm ci             # frozen install from package-lock
cp .env.example .env.local   # see "Environment" below; create this manually
make dev           # next dev on :3000
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in. Two shapes coexist:

- **Static bearer (always available)** — paste the token your cache
  operator issued (matches an entry in `HYPERCACHE_AUTH_CONFIG` on the
  server). Suited for machine integrations, break-glass, and CI.
- **OIDC sign-in (when `AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER` is set)** — a "Sign in with
  &lt;provider&gt;" button renders above the form and runs the auth.js v5
  redirect flow against your IdP (Keycloak, Auth0, Microsoft Entra,
  Okta, or any standards-compliant OIDC provider). The IdP-issued
  access token is sealed into the same iron-session shape as a pasted
  bearer; downstream proxy code is unaware of the source.

Either path lands on Topology.

### Try OIDC end-to-end without configuring an IdP

[`examples/oidc/`](examples/oidc/) ships a self-contained Docker stack:
a 5-node HyperCache cluster + a pre-seeded Keycloak realm + the
Monitor, all wired together. Bring it up with one command:

```bash
make start-oidc          # builds + starts the full stack
make oidc-logs           # tail logs
make stop-oidc           # stop (preserves Keycloak state)
make clean-oidc          # full teardown including volumes
```

Three test users are pre-created (`admin`/`admin`, `ops`/`ops`,
`viewer`/`viewer`) covering every scope combination the cache
understands. See [examples/oidc/README.md](examples/oidc/README.md)
for the operator guide and the one-time `/etc/hosts` step.

## Environment

Validated at boot via zod ([src/env/server.ts](src/env/server.ts)) — the
process refuses to start on any missing or malformed value.

At least one cluster source must be configured: either
`HYPERCACHE_MONITOR_CLUSTERS` (recommended) or both
`HYPERCACHE_API_URL` + `HYPERCACHE_MGMT_URL`. If both are set, the
YAML wins and the env-pair is ignored (logged at boot).

OIDC config is all-or-nothing: zod's `superRefine`
([src/env/server.ts](src/env/server.ts)) rejects partial `AUTH_OIDC_*`
configurations at boot — the monitor refuses to start rather than
render an OIDC button that 500s the moment an operator clicks it.

### Multi-cluster registry

For multi-cluster operation, point `HYPERCACHE_MONITOR_CLUSTERS` at
a YAML file mapping cluster id → metadata. See
[`clusters.example.yaml`](clusters.example.yaml) for the full shape:

```yaml
default:
  name: "Local cluster"
  apiBaseUrl: "http://cache:8080"
  mgmtBaseUrl: "http://cache:8081"
prod-eu:
  name: "Production EU"
  apiBaseUrl: "https://cache-eu.example.com"
  mgmtBaseUrl: "https://cache-eu.example.com:8081"
```

Cluster ids must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` — they appear in proxy
URLs and TanStack queryKeys. The login form renders a cluster
`<Select>` when more than one cluster is registered; the topbar
picker flips between clusters the operator has authenticated
against. Each cluster requires a separate token (issued by that
cluster's `HYPERCACHE_AUTH_CONFIG`); switching to a cluster the
session has not bound credentials for redirects to
`/login?cluster=<id>`.

**Hostname-aware default (Phase C2).** Each entry may include an
optional `hosts: [...]` allowlist of bare hostnames (lowercase, no
scheme, no port). When the monitor serves multiple hostnames from a
single binary, the matching `Host` header on `/login` preselects
that cluster in the picker. Two clusters cannot claim the same
host (loader rejects at boot). The Host header is never consulted
in any auth gate — purely a UX default; operators always pick
freely from the dropdown.

**Live reload (Phase C2).** The YAML file is `fs.watchFile`-polled
on a 2-second interval. Edits propagate to the running monitor
without a restart. Bad parses (typo, duplicate host, removed file)
log to stderr and keep the previous valid registry — operators
iterate without bringing the monitor down. Single-cluster
deployments need no YAML and keep working with the legacy
`HYPERCACHE_API_URL` / `HYPERCACHE_MGMT_URL` pair.

**Per-cluster identity (Phase C2).** The login flow probes
`GET /v1/me` on the selected cluster. The cache returns the
operator's resolved identity (token ID or mTLS subject CN) and
the actual scopes the bound credential carries — no more optimistic
three-scope grants. Pre-Phase-C2 cache binaries return 404 on
`/v1/me`; the monitor surfaces a clear "cache server too old"
error instead of a generic upstream failure.

## Quality gates

The [Makefile](Makefile) is the contract per
[AGENTS.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md) §4. Before declaring a task done:

```bash
make ci    # fmt-check + lint + typecheck + test + sec + build
make e2e   # Playwright + axe-core a11y
```

Individual gates while iterating:

| Target           | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make fmt`       | Auto-format with Prettier.                                  |
| `make fmt-check` | Verify formatting (CI-friendly).                            |
| `make lint`      | ESLint flat config.                                         |
| `make typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`.                                             |
| `make test`      | Vitest unit + component tests (235 tests across 28 files).  |
| `make e2e`       | Playwright + axe-core (24 scenarios across 9 spec files).   |
| `make sec`       | `npm audit --audit-level=high`.                             |
| `make build`     | Production build (`next build`, standalone output).         |
| `make codegen`   | Regenerate the typed OpenAPI client from a running cluster. |

CI runs `make ci` and `make e2e` separately
([.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/)) so a flaky browser test doesn't block lint signal.

## Eviction Controls

`POST /evict`, `POST /clear`, `POST /trigger-expiration` on the cache's
management port require `admin` scope server-side as of Phase C. The
UI's proxy
([src/app/api/clusters/\[clusterId\]/mgmt/control/\[op\]/route.ts](src/app/api/clusters/%5BclusterId%5D/mgmt/control/%5Bop%5D/route.ts))
adds a second gate: it 501s by default, and only forwards when both
flags align —

- `HYPERCACHE_MONITOR_ENABLE_ADMIN_OPS=true` is set on the monitor, AND
- the operator's session carries `admin` scope.

A read-only token can never reach the upstream mutating routes through
the UI even with the env flag on; the cache's per-route policy is
the authoritative gate. The monitor flag exists so air-gapped or
read-only deployments can hide the controls entirely.

| OIDC refresh   | auth.js's jwt callback refreshes against the IdP's token endpoint when the access token is within 30s of expiry.                                 | Discovery-driven (Keycloak/Auth0/Okta paths handled identically). Refresh-token rotation honoured; failures stamp `RefreshAccessTokenError` and bounce the operator to /login.                                                |
| UI session     | iron-session v8, 8-hour TTL, `httpOnly` + `SameSite=Strict` + `Secure` (in production).                                                          | Cookie is signed + encrypted with `IRON_SESSION_SECRET`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Auth.js cookie | Separate JWT-strategy cookie holding the IdP-issued access + id + refresh tokens until the post-callback handler seals access into iron-session. | Signed with `AUTH_SECRET`. On logout, RP-initiated logout hits the IdP's `end_session_endpoint` (server-side, with `id_token_hint`) before clearing the local cookie — silent SSO re-auth doesn't happen on the next sign-in. |
| CSRF           | Origin-header check on mutating verbs in the proxy.                                                                                              | All mutating routes 403 on `Origin` mismatch.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
